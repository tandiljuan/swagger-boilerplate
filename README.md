Swagger 2.0 Boilerplate
=======================


This is a simple example to start with Swagger 2.0. Right now there is no
Swagger-UI (but it's planned).


Current available tools are:

* `npm run validate` To validate the `swagger.yaml` file.
* `npm run server` To create a dummy mock server based in the `swagger.yaml` file.


Before to start, don't forget to install all the dependencies

    npm install


Everything has been possible thanks for the following modules:

* [swagger-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-tools)
* [swagger-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-server)
* [yamljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs)
